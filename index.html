		<h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>
		<p>Hello my name is Leonardo Sanchez and this is my second year of my CSUMB and my second year to take my major Communication Design.
		My hobbies are playing video games, draw digital artwork, walking outside, and listening music. Sometimes I hang out with my friends,
		but sometimes I don't hang out with my friends due to my school. I always encountered my anxiety and I have autism. What I'm a bit
	  excited to learn how to create different colors and use different ways to create website for this class. Hopefully I'll do well in
		this class and I'm looking forward to pass this class.</p>

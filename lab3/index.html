		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>The idea for this lab was to learn how to create website by using codes
		and using local file structure to create an index.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The challenge was that it wasn't that challenging, but it's a bit tricky
		to use codes to create local file structures for creating a website.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The result was that I fiished to create the filing structures for this
		assignment and overall I got it exactly what I need it.</p>
